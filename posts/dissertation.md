I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California,
Berkeley, where I was advised by Professor Sanjit A. Seshia. Check out my
dissertation in
[pdf](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2025/EECS-2025-163.html) or
[html](https://federico.morarocha.ca/thesis/) formats. You can play with the
small modelling language that I created for my thesis by cloning [this git
repository](https://github.com/FedericoAureliano/thesis).
