I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am advised by Sanjit A. Seshia. Before Berkeley, I completed an M.Sc. in computer science at the University of Toronto, where I  was advised by Marsha Chechik, and a B.Sc. in computer science and mathematics at Mount Allison University.</p><p>I am interested in formal methods, programming language theory, and machine learning. Specifically, I am excited about languages that theoretically and empirically lend themselves to efficient automated reasoning.</p>",
