# Profile

I am currently an Applied Scientist in the [Automated Reasoning Group (ARG) at Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning). Starting Fall 2026, I will be an Assistant Professor in the [Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) and a Faculty Affiliate at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

# Research Interests

My research focuses on designing and implementing domain-specific automated reasoning tools for programmers, broadly construed.
