# Profile

![](images/federico.jpg){.headshot}

I am currently an Applied Scientist in the Automated Reasoning Group (ARG) at
Amazon Web Services (AWS). Starting Fall 2026, I will be an Assistant Professor
in the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and a
Faculty Affiliate at the Vector Institute. 

My research focuses on designing and implementing domain-specific automated
reasoning tools for programmers, broadly construed.
