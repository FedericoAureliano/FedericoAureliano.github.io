  <h1>Answering Questions About DNA Sequences on StackOverflow with a Sequence Solver</h1>

  <p id="noteblock0">
    We recently submitted a paper describing a new SMT solver for the theory of
    strings. To celebrate, I thought I'd go on StackOverflow, search for
    questions related to DNA sequences, and answer some of them using a sequence
    solver.<sup><a href="#footnote0">0</a></sup>

  <h2><a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53267820/generating-dna-sequence-excluding-specific-sequence">Generating
      DNA sequence excluding specific sequence</a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    I've just started to learn programming with python. In class we were asked to
    generate a random DNA sequence, that does NOT contain a specific 6-letter
    sequence (AACGTT). The point is to make a funtion that always return a legal
    sequence. Currently my function generates a correct sequence about 78% of the
    time. How can I make it return a legal sqeuence 100% of the time? Any help is
    appreciated.
  </blockquote>

  <p id="noteblock1">
    Let's take "generate a random DNA sequence" to mean "generate some DNA
    sequence" and let's write something like an <small>SMT-LIB</small><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> query to
    help this student. The first thing we
    need to do is define<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> nucleotides. We'll do
    this through an enumerated type with members A, C, T, and G.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
(declare-datatype Nucleotide (A C T G))
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Next we'll declare the variable that we want to solve for: a sequence of
    nucleotides called DNA1.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
(declare-const DNA1 (Seq Nucleotide))
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Then we'll assert that DNA1 is at least six nucleotides long (to avoid
    trivial solutions), and does not contain the sequence AACGTT, as desired.
    Finally we'll ask the solver to give us a solution. Voil√†. That's it.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
(assert (>= (seq.len DNA1) 6))
(assert (not (seq.contains DNA1 AACGTT)))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
</code></pre>

  <p>
    OK I lied. Writing literal sequences is a bit ugly so I snuck a macro
    in there that builds the literal sequence units and concatenates them all together. Here is the full query.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
(declare-datatype Nucleotide (A C T G))
(declare-const DNA1 (Seq Nucleotide))

(define-fun AACGTT () (Seq Nucleotide)
  (seq.++ (seq.unit A) 
          (seq.unit A) 
          (seq.unit C) 
          (seq.unit G) 
          (seq.unit T) 
          (seq.unit T)))

(assert (>= (seq.len DNA1) 6))
(assert (not (seq.contains DNA1 AACGTT)))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
</code></pre>

  <p id="noteblock2">
    Running <small>Z3</small><sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> on this query gives
    us the answer AAAAAA. Somewhat underwhelming but 100%
    correct&trade;. On the bright side, we now know enough about the input language to tackle more interesting
    questions.
  </p>

  <h2><a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2420412/search-for-string-allowing-for-one-mismatch-in-any-location-of-the-string">Search
      for string allowing for one mismatch in any location of the string</a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    I am working with DNA sequences of length 25... [I want] to find a close match defined as wrong (mismatched) at
    any location, but only one location, and record the location in the sequence. I
    am not sure how do do this... For example,
    <br><br>
    AGCCTCCCATGATTGAACAGATCAT
    <br>
    AGCCTCCCATGATAGAACAGATCAT
    <br><br>
    is a close match with a mismatch at position 13...
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    A complete solution to this problem would require a loop over the elements
    of the database. We'll just write an <small>SMT-LIB</small>-like query to
    find the single position at which two (hard-coded) input DNA sequences
    differ, if it exists. The full query for the given example (omitting
    macros) is
  </p>

  <pre><code>
(declare-const X (Seq Nucleotide))
(declare-const Y (Seq Nucleotide))

(declare-const m Nucleotide)
(declare-const n Nucleotide)

(assert (= XmY AGCCTCCCATGATTGAACAGATCAT))
(assert (= XnY AGCCTCCCATGATAGAACAGATCAT))

(assert (not (= n m)))

(check-sat)
(get-value ((seq.len X)))
</code></pre>

  <p>
    The first block of commands declares two nucleotide sequence variables, X and Y, that we will use to hold
    sub-sequences of the input DNA sequences. The second block of commands declares two nucleotide variables, n and m,
    that will
    hold the pair of nucleotides that differ. The third block asserts that both input
    DNA sequences begin with X, end with Y, and have some nucleotide&mdash;n
    and m respectively&mdash;in between. The fourth block asserts that n and m
    are different. Finally, the fifth block asks
    the solver to find a solution and print it (in our encoding, the length of X is the position at which the DNA
    sequences differ).
    <small>Z3</small> quickly returns the correct solution: the position is 13.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
sat
(((seq.len X) 13))
</code></pre>

  <p>
    If the two input DNA sequences were
    the same or differed by more than
    one nucleotide, then <small>Z3</small> would have returned unsat.
  </p>

  <blockquote>

    For example, given: <br><br>
    1/ATCGAAATTCCGGAAGGGGTGG<br>
    ...<br>
    5/ATTATTGTTCACTATTT

    I tried ... but I don't know how to retrieve the order of each result that has
    appeared in the original sequences. That is, whether TTCC and TCG appear first and second respectively ... Thank you for your insights.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This one is a little more tricky, but we can use a familiar technique to encode it. At a high level, we want to
    decompose an input DNA sequence into five pieces. The second and fourth pieces will try to match to TCG or TTCC. The
    first, third, and fifth pieces will hold the rest of the input.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
(declare-const X (Seq Nucleotide))
(declare-const M (Seq Nucleotide))
(declare-const Y (Seq Nucleotide))
(declare-const N (Seq Nucleotide))
(declare-const Z (Seq Nucleotide))

(assert (= (seq.++ X M Y N Z) INPUT))
(assert (or (= M TCG) (= M TTCC)))
(assert (or (= N TCG) (= N TTCC) (= N EMPTY)))
(assert (=> (= N EMPTY)
    (and (not (seq.contains (seq.++ Y Z) TCG))
         (not (seq.contains (seq.++ Y Z) TTCC))
         (not (seq.contains X TCG))
         (not (seq.contains X TTCC)))))

(check-sat)
(get-value (M (seq.len X)))
(get-value (N (seq.len (seq.++ X M Y))))
</code></pre>

  <p>
    More specifically, we declare five variables: X, M, Y, N, Z. The first
    assertion decomposes the input so that M represents the first match, N
    represents the second match, and X, Y and Z represent the rest of the
    input. The second assertion forces M to match to one of TCG and TTCC; the
    third assertion does the same for N, but allows for it to be empty. Letting
    N be empty is good because it lets us capture cases where there is
    only one occurrence of TCG or TTCC, but it is bad because the solver can
    choose to always match N with the empty sequence. The fourth assertion blocks this: it
    asserts that N is only empty if there is nothing to match it to. Finally,
    with the get-value commands, we ask the solver to tell us where TTCC and
    TCG appear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Plugging in ATCGAAATTCCGGAAGGGGTGG for INPUT and running <small>Z3</small>
    gives us that the first match, N, is TCG at index 1, and that the second match, M, is
    TTCC at index 7.
  </p>

<pre><code>
sat
((M (seq.++ (seq.unit T) 
            (seq.unit C) 
            (seq.unit G)))
 ((seq.len X) 1))
((N (seq.++ (seq.unit T) 
            (seq.unit T) 
            (seq.unit C) 
            (seq.unit C)))
 ((seq.len (seq.++ X M Y)) 7))
</code></pre>

  <p>
    With ATTATTGTTCACTATTT the solver gives us unsat, since there are no matches.
  </p>


  <h2>What Does it All Mean?</h2>
  <p id="noteblock3">
    I think the biggest takeaway is that you can encode a lot of problems using
    only concatenation and equality.<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> When
    I first searched "dna sequence" on StackOverflow I wasn't expecting it to
    be so easy to find problems that I could quickly express and solve with
    <small>Z3</small>. The encodings don't even need regular expressions!<sup><a
    href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe one day I'll revisit this post to talk about the sequence logic and
    how these solvers work. In the meantime, is anyone actually using automated
    reasoning on DNA sequences? Scalability would surely be an issue.
