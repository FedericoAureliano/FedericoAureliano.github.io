Think of ```/docs``` as the build target---try not to edit anything in here directly. Most of the files here are generated by running ```python3 build.py```. If you want to update your website, then edit ```build.py``` or the files in ```/data``` or ```/templates```, and then re-run ```python3 build.py```.

**NOTE**: remember to remove or replace ```docs/CNAME```.
